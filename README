Gtk2::Ex::ListModelConcat presents the contents of multiple list type
Gtk2::TreeModel objects as a single concatenated list.  Changes in the
sub-models are reported up, and changes can be applied down through
the Concat model, if the sub-models are editable.

The prerequisites are Gtk2-Perl and my Glib-Ex-ObjectBits.  The
